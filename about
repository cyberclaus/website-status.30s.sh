This plugin lets you enter as much website urls as you like and checks them for availability.
This means it doesn't just ping the url but it gets the header of the http telegram and wnats to get a return code 200
which means that the browser could show some content. If anything else than a return code 200 is comming back
the website is not available. 

The plugin show a green LED is the site is up and running and a red one if not.

The LED in the menubar shows a summary of all checked websites:

green: if all checked websites are up
organge: if one or some are up and minimum one is not
red: if all chekced urls are down
